Project Participation and Contribution Terms

Revised: January 25, 2013

In consideration of (a) access provided to me by or on behalf of O’Reilly Media, Inc. (“ORM”) to the content development and publication tools and system currently known as “Atlas” and “Chimera” (collectively, the “Platform”), and/or (b) the opportunity provided to me by or on behalf of ORM to participate in and to make contributions to one or more ORM content development projects (collectively, the “ORM Project”) using the Platform, and/or (c) the opportunity provided to me by or on behalf of ORM to access and use the Platform for authoring and developing content projects originated by me and that apart from my authorized use of the Platform under these Terms, is independent of ORM (such independent content projects, collectively, “Participant Content”), I agree to be legally bound by these Participation and Contribution Terms (“Terms”). 

I acknowledge and agree that: 

1. ORM’s consent to my access to and use of the Platform, including without limitation my participation in and contribution to the ORM Project and/or my access to and use of the Platform with respect to my Participant Content, is conditioned on my compliance with these Terms and the Atlas Guidelines, and whether my use/access to the Platform is in relation to the ORM Project or my Participant Content, I will not share my password or otherwise share with or transfer my access to the Platform to anyone without ORM’s prior express written permission;

2. the Platform and the ORM Project are in development, access is provided to me only for purposes for evaluation, testing, and feedback to ORM, and/or for purposes of the development of the relevant work(s) in the case of the ORM Project or my use of the Platform in connection with my Participant Content;

3. prior to ORM’s public launch of the relevant aspects of the Platform and/or the ORM Project, and/or except as expressly authorized in advance and in writing by ORM (a) I will not disclose to anyone other than ORM any feedback or any other information regarding or related to the Platform and/or my use or access to it , including without limitation use/access relating to my Participant Content and/or the ORM Project or my ORM Project participation, and (b) I will not make or authorize anyone to make on my behalf any public statements about the Platform, the ORM Project, or my ORM Project participation;

4. my use of and access to the Platform (including use and/or access in connection with my Participant Content), and/or my participation in the ORM Project is at my own risk, and ORM makes no warranties whatsoever with respect to the Platform, the ORM Project, and disclaims to the extent permitted by law implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and I acknowledge that it is my sole responsibility to maintain such back-ups of my Participant Content as I may require and that ORM is not obligated to maintain back-ups of Participant Content for my benefit;

5. my feedback regarding my use and access of the Platform, and other non-public information regarding the Platform and the ORM Project and/or my participation in the ORM Project constitute valuable trade secrets of ORM which I agree to keep confidential until the relevant aspect(s) of the Platform and/or the ORM Project is publicly launched by ORM; 

6. ORM and its content providers are the owners of all rights in and to the Platform and the ORM Project, but ORM agrees and acknowledges that I reserve my ownership in the copyright in any feedback, contributions, and suggestions regarding and/ or contributed to the Platform and/or the ORM Project (collectively, “Contributions”), provided however that I hereby grant ORM and its licensees and assigns (the “ORM Parties”) the irrevocable and non-exclusive right in their sole discretion to use my Contributions as they deem appropriate in connection with the Platform, the ORM Project, and/or any other work, product or service, and ORM Parties will not have any obligation or liability to me with respect any use and/or incorporation of any of my Contributions (as submitted by me, or as modified or combined with other content by or on behalf of the ORM Parties) into the Platform, the ORM Project, or any other work, product or service; 

7. I reserve all of my rights in and to my Participant Content, provided however that I grant to ORM such non-exclusive rights therein as may be necessary in order for ORM to facilitate my access to and use of the Platform relating to my Participant Content;

8. my use and access to the Platform, my participation in the ORM Project, my Contributions, and my Participant Content will not (i) include unauthorized disclosure(s) of personal information, trade secrets, or confidential information; (ii) violate anyone's rights, including without limitation intellectual property rights; (iii) contain software viruses or any other elements designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any software, systems, or devices; (iv) contain or link to commercial solicitations;(v) contain data or technology subject to restriction under laws regulating the export and other dissemination of information or technology; and (vi) be inaccurate, defamatory, obscene, harassing, or otherwise objectionable in a manner which would support third party legal claims. As between me and ORM, I assume all risk and consequences resulting from any third party's use of any Contribution, and any use made by me or any third party of my Participant Content. I grant to the ORM Parties, the perpetual, irrevocable right, but not the obligation, to use the name under which I submit content in connection with any subsequent use of my Contributions;

9. California law and applicable U.S. federal law govern these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, and I agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California, U.S.A.; and

10. ORM may amend these Terms at any time by posting the amended Terms with or without notice to me on https://github.com/oreillymedia/atlas_participation_agreement/blob/master/atlas_tos.asciidoc, and my participation and/or contribution to any Project after such posting will constitute consent to the modified Terms. 

A current version of these Terms will always be available at https://github.com/oreillymedia/atlas_participation_agreement/blob/master/atlas_tos.asciidoc.
