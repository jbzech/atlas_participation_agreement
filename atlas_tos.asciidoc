Privileged and Confidential

Project Participation and Contribution Terms

Revised: August 6, 2012

In consideration of access provided to me by or on behalf of O’Reilly Media, Inc. (“ORM”) to the beta versions of the content development and publication tools and system currently known as “Atlas”, and/or the opportunity provided to me by or on behalf of ORM to participate in and to make contributions to one or more content development projects (collectively, the “Project”), I agree to be legally bound by these Participation and Contribution Terms (“Terms”). I acknowledge and agree that: 

1. ORM’s consent to my participation in and contribution to each Project is conditioned on my compliance with these Terms and the Atlas Guidelines, and I will not share my password or otherwise share or transfer my access to any Project to anyone without ORM’s prior express written permission;

2.  each Project is in development, access is provided to me only for purposes for evaluation, testing, and feedback to ORM, and/or for purposes of the development of the relevant work(s) in the case of content development projects;

3.  with respect to each Project, prior to ORM’s public launch of that Project (a) I will not disclose to anyone other than ORM  any feedback or any other information regarding or related to the Project or my Project participation, and (b) I will not make or authorize anyone to make on my behalf any public statements about the Project or my Project participation;

4. my participation in each Project is at my own risk, and ORM makes no warranties whatsoever with respect to the Project(s), and disclaims to the extent permitted by law implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose;

5. my feedback regarding each Project and other information regarding each Project and/or my participation in the Project constitutes valuable trade secrets of ORM which I agree to keep confidential until that Project is publicly launched by ORM; 

6. ORM and its content providers are the owners of all rights in and to each Project, and ORM agrees and acknowledges that I reserve my ownership in the copyright in any feedback, contributions, and suggestions regarding and/ or contributed to each Project (collectively, “Contributions”), provided however that I grant ORM and its licensees and assigns (the “ORM Parties”) the irrevocable and non-exclusive right in their sole discretion to use my Contributions as they deem appropriate in connection with any Project or any other work, product or service, and ORM Parties will not have any obligation or liability to me with respect any use and/or incorporation of any of my Contributions (as submitted by me, or as modified or combined with other content by or on behalf of the ORM Parties) into any Project or any other work, product or service; 

7. my participation in the Project(s) and my Contributions will not (i) include unauthorized disclosure(s) of personal information, trade secrets, or confidential information; (ii) violate anyone's rights, including without limitation intellectual property rights; (iii) contain software viruses or any other elements designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any software, systems, or devices; (iv) contain or link to commercial solicitations;(v) contain data or technology subject to restriction under laws regulating the export and other dissemination of information or technology; and (vi) be inaccurate, defamatory, obscene, harassing, or otherwise objectionable in a manner which would support third party legal claims. As between me and O'Reilly, I assume all risk and consequences resulting from any third party's use of any Contribution. I grant to the ORM Parties, the perpetual, irrevocable right, but not the obligation, to use the name under which I submit content in connection with any subsequent use of my Contributions;

8. if any provision of these Terms could be interpreted to apply to any of my Contributions in a manner that conflicts with any provision of any other written agreement between me and ORM, the conflicting provision the other written agreement shall supersede the conflicting provision these Terms with respect to that Contribution; 

9. California law and applicable U.S. federal law govern these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, and I agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California, U.S.A; and

10. You agree that we may amend these Terms at any time by posting the amended Terms on https://github.com/oreillymedia/atlas_participation_agreement/blob/master/atlas_tos.asciidoc, without notice to you. Your participation and/or contribution to any Project after such posting will constitute consent to the modified TOS. A current version of these Terms will always be available at https://github.com/oreillymedia/atlas_participation_agreement/blob/master/atlas_tos.asciidoc. It is your responsibility to review the Terms from time-to-time in order to be informed of modifications.
